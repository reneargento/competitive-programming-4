The alternative solution is to do only one simulation and compute the maximum fuel needed.
Start with a fuel counter with value zero and increment it based on the distance travelled and fuel consumption events.
Also increment the counter based on the leaks.
Every time a gas station event happens, reset the counter, keeping track of what was the highest fuel needed so far.
The highest fuel needed will be the smallest possible tank volume.
