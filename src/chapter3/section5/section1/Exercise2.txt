3.5.1.2

The state formulation dp(g, model), where g is the current garment and model is the current model, is not appropriate
and exhaustive for the UVa 11450 problem.
This is because we need to know how much money we have left at each sub-problem so that we can determine if we still
have enough money to buy a certain model of the current garment.
