Ruffini-Horner's method for finding the roots of a polynomial equation f(x) = 0 is based on a combination of Newton's method and polynomial long division (using Horner's method).
With that combination, it is possible to approximate the real roots of a polynomial.

Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (zeros) of a real-valued function.
Polynomial long division is an algorithm for diving a polynomial by another polynomial of the same or lower degree.
Horner's method rearranges a polynomial to evaluate it using fewer operations.

The algorithm works as follows:
Given a polynomial pn(x) of degree n with zeros zn < zn-1 < ... < z1, make some initial guess x0 such that z1 < x0.
Now iterate the following two steps:
1- Using Newton's method, find the largest zero z1 of pn(x) using the guess x0.
2- Using Horner's method, divide out (x - z1) to obtain pn-1.
   Return to step 1 but use the polynomial pn-1 and the initial guess z1.
These two steps are repeated until all real zeros are found for the polynomial.
If the approximated zeros are not precise enough, the obtained values can be used as initial guesses for Newton's method, but using the full polynomial instead of the reduced polynomial.
