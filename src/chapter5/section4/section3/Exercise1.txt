5.4.3.1

Assuming that n is an arbitrary large integer, fib(n) is the hardest to factorize.
This is because fib(n) tends to behave more randomly in terms of prime distribution.
Some fib(n) are prime and others have large prime factors that are not easy to predict.
Due to that, large Fibonacci numbers are even used in primality testing benchmarks.
Both C(n, k), with k = n / 2, and Cat(n) are highly composite, dominated by small primes with large multiplicities.
Their prime structure is very smooth, with few large prime factors.
With C(n, k), prime factorization can also be determined efficiently using Legendre's formula.
