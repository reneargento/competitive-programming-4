5.4.4.8

The number of ways to select a group of people such that the number of boys is equal to the number of girls in the chosen group is:

Consider B to be the total number of boys and G to be the total number of girls.
Consider M to be the minimum of (B, G).

Number of ways = B1 * G1 + B2 * G2 + ... + BM * GM
Where Bx means from a total of B, choose x people.
