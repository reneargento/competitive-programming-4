2.3.1.3

Statement: The second largest item in a Max Heap with n >= 3 distinct items is always one of the direct children of the root.
The statement is true.
The second largest item in a Max Heap can have only 1 item above it because only 1 item is larger than it.
Therefore, it must be in the second level of the heap, which is where the direct children of the root are located.

Follow up question: Potential location(s) for the third largest item.
The third largest item can have 1 or 2 items above it.
This is because the siblings are not necessarily sorted.
So the third largest item could be a direct child of the root and have the second largest item as a sibling (on either indexes 2 or 3).
Also, it can be the child of the second largest item, which can be either the left or right child of the root.
In this case, the third largest item would be located on the third level of heap.
As siblings are not necessarily sorted, it could be on indexes 4 or 5 (if the second largest item is the left child of the root),
or on indexes 6 or 7 (if the second largest item is the right child of the root).
Therefore, the third largest item can be on any of the indexes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
