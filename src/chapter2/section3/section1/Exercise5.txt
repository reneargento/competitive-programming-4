2.3.1.5

Given a 1-based compact array A containing n integers satisfying the Max Heap property.
To output all items in A that are greater than an integer v:

Set i = 1.
Check if the item at index i is greater than v.
If it is, output it and recurse on indexes 2 * i and (2 * i) + 1 (if the indexes are valid).
Otherwise, return.

Since the array integers satisfy the Max Heap property we know that if the current item is not greater than v, none of its children will be.
