2.3.1.6

Given an unsorted array S of n distinct integers we can find the largest and smallest k integers in O(n log k) in the following way:

1. Create two heaps, a Min Heap minPQ and a Max Heap maxPQ.
2. Iterate through all integers in S.
3. For every integer in S, check both minPQ and maxPQ. If any of them has less than k elements, insert the integer.
If minPQ has k elements: Check if the current integer is larger than the top element of the heap.
    If it is, extract the top element and insert it.
If maxPQ has k elements: Check if the current integer is smaller than the top element of the heap.
    If it is, extract the top element and insert it.

At the end of iteration minPQ will contain the largest k integers and maxPQ will contain the smallest k integers.
For each of the n integers we may do extract and insert operations on minPQ and maxPQ, both of which have a maximum size of k.
This takes in total O(n log k).
