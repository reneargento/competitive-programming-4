2.3.1.7

If we only need the DecreaseKey(oldKey, newKey) operation we can use lazy deletion on the oldKey in the following way:
1. Insert the newKey on the priority queue.
2. Keep track of deleted items on a hash map. The keys on the hash maps are the deleted keys and the values are the frequency in which that key was deleted.
3. Search for oldKey on the hash map. If it does not exist, insert it with a value of 1.
If it exists, increment its frequency counter.
4. Every time we dequeue a key from the priority queue check if it exists on the hash map.
If it does not exist, dequeue works as usual.
If it exists, decrement the frequency counter related to the key and ignore the dequeue result. Dequeue again until finding a valid key or until the priority queue is empty.
If the frequency counter for any key in the hash map becomes 0, remove the key from the hash map.
