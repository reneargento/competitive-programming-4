2.3.3.2

To support many dynamic insertions and deletions and many requests for the data in sorted order we should use a balanced binary search tree (Java TreeSet or C++ STL set).
It will handle insertions and deletions in O(log n) and outputting data in sorted order in O(n) with an inorder traversal.
If data no longer needs to be output in a sorted way a Java hash set (or C++ STL unordered_set) can be used, handling insertions and deletions in O(1) and outputting data in O(n).
