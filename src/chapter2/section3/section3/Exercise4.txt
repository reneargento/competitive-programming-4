The code also produces the BST items in sorted order.
It can be made to run in a total time of O(n) instead of O(n log n) by keeping track of the nodes as we recurse to the left sub-trees.
A stack can be used and every time we recurse to the left sub-tree the current node would be pushed to the stack.
Once there is no left sub-tree, print the key. Then recurse to the right sub-tree.
If there is no left and no right sub-trees, print and pop the key at the top of the stack. Recurse on the right sub-tree of the popped key.
Continue until the stack is empty.
This algorithm will run in a total time of O(n).
