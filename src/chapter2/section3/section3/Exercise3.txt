1. Check if T is a BST.
Do an inorder traversal and check if the keys are sorted. Time complexity: O(n).

2. Output the items in T that are within a given range [a..b] in ascending order.
Do an inorder traversal and during the traversal if the key is in the range [a..b], print it. Time complexity: O(n).

3. Output the contents of the leaves of T in descending order.
Do a level order traversal on T and store the contents of the keys that are leaves (they are the keys with no children).
The level order traversal will visit the leaves in ascending order.
After finishing the traversal output the contents from the end to the start.
