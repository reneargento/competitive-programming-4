2.3.2.5

To hash a pair of integers that represents a cell (r, c) in a 2D array of size N x M it is possible to use the following function:
h(r, c, M, S) = (r * M + c) % S

Where S is the number of buckets in the hash table.
This will generate unique numbers for each cell that will then be used to generate a hash after applying the MOD operation.
