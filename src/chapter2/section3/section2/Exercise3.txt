2.3.2.3

Given the M strings, N of which are unique, we can index them from [0..N-1] in the following way:
Create a hash table.
Iterate over the M strings.
For every string, if it does not exist in the hash table:
   Assign it the index equal to the hash table size and insert it into the hash table with a value equal to its index.
If it exists in the hash table:
   Search for the string in the hash table and get its value (index).
   Assign the current string the same index.
