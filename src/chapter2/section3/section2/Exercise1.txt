1. Search(8)
Compute h(8) = 8 % 11 = 8.
Check cell/slot 8 and the first key is 8. Return it.

Search(35)
Compute h(35) = 35 % 11 = 2.
Check cell/slot 2 and iterate over the list in it.
The third key is 35. Return it.

Search(77)
Compute h(77) = 77 % 11 = 0.
Check cell/slot 0 and iterate over the list.
After iterating over all the list and not finding 77, return null.

2. Insert(77)
Compute h(77) = 77 % 11 = 0.
Check cell/slot 0 and iterate over the list.
Insert 77 after the key 11.

Insert(13)
Compute h(13) = 13 % 11 = 2.
Check cell/slot 2 and iterate over the list.
Key 13 already exists, so return.

Insert(19)
Compute h(19) = 19 % 11 = 8.
Check cell/slot 8 and iterate over the list.
Insert 19 after the key 8.

3. Remove(9)
Compute h(9) = 9 % 11 = 9.
Check cell/slot 9. The list is empty, so return.

Remove(7)
Compute h(7) = 7 % 11 = 7.
Check cell/slot 7 and iterate over the list.
The key 7 is found at the end of the list. Remove it by updating the next reference of key 18 to null.

Remove(13)
Compute h(13) = 13 % 11 = 2.
Check cell/slot 2 and iterate over the list.
The key 13 is found at the second position of the list. Remove it by updating the next reference of key 24 to key 35.
