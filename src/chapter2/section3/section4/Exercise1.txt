2.3.4.1

To handle duplicates in the tree we can use the less_equal<int> comparator when defining the tree:
typedef tree<int, null_type, less_equal<int>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> ost;

Note that when using the less_equal comparator the lower_bound() function works as upper_bound() and vice-versa.
