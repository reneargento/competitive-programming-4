2.4.1.7

Always storing vertex numbers in increasing order inside the Adjacency List is not always a good idea.
There are cases when the vertex numbers need to be stored in a different order.
For example, to compute the faces of a planar graph the vertices should be stored in clockwise order given by the planar embedding of the graph.
