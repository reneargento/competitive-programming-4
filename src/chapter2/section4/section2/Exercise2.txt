2.4.2.2

Sequence of unionSet(i, j) operations to create a tree with rank = log2(N):
unionSet(0, 1)
unionSet(2, 3)
...
unionSet(N-2, N-1)

This will reduce the number of disjoint sets from N to N / 2.
Repeat the process until there is only one set left.
unionSet(0, 2)
unionSet(4, 6)
...
unionSet(N-4, N-2)

This creates a tree with rank = log2(N).
It is not possible to create a tree with rank > log2(N).
This is because after each iteration of the above unionSet operations, the number of disjoint sets is reduced by half and the sets rank increases by 1.
So in total there will be log2(N) iterations, each increasing the sets rank by 1.
This is the worst possible case, so a tree with rank > log2(N) is not possible to be created.
