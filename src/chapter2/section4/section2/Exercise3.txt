2.4.2.3

Sequence of unionSet(i, j) and findSet(i) operations to create a tree with the shortest possible height:
unionSet(0, 1)
unionSet(0, 2)
unionSet(0, 3)
...
unionSet(0, N-1)

Without the "union by rank" heuristic the resulting tree can be as tall as N - 1.
This tree can be flattened to a star graph by calling:
findSet(0)
findSet(1)
...
findSet(N - 1)

This will compress the paths from all vertices to the root and will create a tree with height 1.
