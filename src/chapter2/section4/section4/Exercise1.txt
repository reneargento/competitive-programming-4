2.4.4.1

Note that the exercise refers to the segment tree described in exercise 2.4.4.2.
RSQ(1, 7) = 167
RSQ(3, 8) = 139

If array A is never changed using a Segment Tree is overkill.
A better approach is to use the prefix sum technique.
With it a pre-processing is done in O(n) time and all queries are answered in O(1) time.

If array A is frequently changed a better approach is to use a Fenwick Tree.
Both a Segment Tree and a Fenwick Tree can answer the RSQ queries in O(log n) time, but the Fenwick Tree is simpler to code.
