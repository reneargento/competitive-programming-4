2.4.4.4

Deleting an existing value will possibly invalidate its parent nodes on the segment tree.
This could happen if the deleted value was the smallest value in the range represented by one or more of its parent nodes.
To address that, after a deletion, walk from that leaf node parent to the root of the segment tree, updating the nodes' values when necessary.
Replace the deleted node parent with its other child node. Delete that child node too.
This is useful to avoid having nodes with only one child.
For each other node in the path to the root, compare its both children (one of which may have a new value) and update its value if necessary.
If any node do not need to be updated during the path, the algorithm can finish because no other nodes above it will be updated.

Inserting a new value will require the same process of updating the leaf node's parents.
This is because the inserted value may be smaller than all other nodes represented on parent node ranges.
