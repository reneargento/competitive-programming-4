There are different approaches to use Radix sort when the array has negative numbers.

One approach is to identify the minimum value in the array. Let's call this value delta.
Increment all values in the array by delta so that there are no negative numbers.
Sort the array using Radix sort and then decrement all values by delta.

Another approach is to treat the sign as a separate digit, the most significant one.
Then the last pass would have two buckets: negative and positive numbers.
When moving the numbers from the negative bucket to the final array, move them in the reverse order.
