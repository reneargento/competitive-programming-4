2.2.2.3

In Kattis - magicsequence the range of numbers is [1 ... 10^9].
Ideally we would use a radix of 10^9 and sort the array in just one pass of radix sort, but that would require too much memory.
Using a radix higher than sqrt(10^9) we can sort the array in just two passes.
Also, if the radix is a power of 2 we can use bitwise operations instead of the division and mod operations (which seems
necessary to get the problem accepted when implementing it in Java).
The nearest number (rounded up) which is a power of 2 and is higher than sqrt(10^9) is 2^15 (32768).
So the appropriate radix (base) to solve Kattis - magicsequence is 2^15.
