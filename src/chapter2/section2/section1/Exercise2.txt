2.2.1.2

Test case that will make the algorithm run in O(n^2):
An array with all equal values such as [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Quick fix: partition in three sections.
The left section will contain elements smaller than the pivot, the middle section will contain elements equal to the pivot
and the right section will contain elements bigger than the pivot.
Then, recurse only on the left and right sections.
This algorithm is known as 3-Way Quicksort, or the Dutch national flag algorithm.
