4.6.3.2

Randomizing the vertex order in Adjacency List instead of keeping it ordered based on increasing vertex number is good for the MCBM algorithm.
This is because in the worst case, with a Complete Bipartite Graph K(N/2,N/2), MCBM will run in O(V^3).
With randomization many trivial (one-edge) Augmenting Paths that consist of a free vertex u, and unmatched edge (u, v)
and a free vertex v are eliminated, which avoids the algorithms' worst case of O(V^3).
