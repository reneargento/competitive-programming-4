4.4.3.1

If there are two (or more) different vertices that have similar shortest path distance values from the source vertex s there is no problem.
The vertex information pair of a vertex u is (dist[u], u), and the vertex numbers are unique.
So even if different vertices have the same shortest path distance value from source vertex s, they will still be different keys on a set<ii>.
