If that line is removed, the modified Dijkstra's algorithm performance will degenerate.
This is because it will process all inferior vertex information pairs (that should have been deleted earlier) instead of skipping them immediately.
The modified Dijkstra's algorithm should still remain correct, as inferior vertex information pairs will not cause any successful edge relaxation.
