4.4.1.3

Claim: If there is only one possible path from vertex u to vertex v in a general weighted graph and u is reachable from the source vertex s, then the shortest path from s to v must be s -> ... -> u -> ... -> v!

Proof by contradiction:
We know from the statement that the path P1 exists: s -> ... -> u -> ... -> v
Consider a shortest path P2 that does not include vertex u: s -> ... -> v
If P2 existed that would mean that a cycle exists and vertex u would be able to reach vertex v through the following path:
u -> ... -> s -> ... -> v

That is a contradiction since there is only one possible path from vertex u to vertex v (vertex u is an articulation point).
Therefore the only possible path (and consequently, shortest path) from vertex s to vertex v is P1: s -> ... -> u -> ... -> v.
