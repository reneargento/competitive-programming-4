4.2.10.1

Statement: "If two vertices are in the same SCC, then there is no path between them that ever leaves the SCC".

Proof by contradiction:
Assume there is a vertex w outside the SCC, there are vertices u and v that are in the SCC and that there exists a path
u -> w -> v.

If w is reachable by u, it is also reachable by all the vertices in the SCC, since all vertices in the SCC can reach u.
If w can reach v, it can also reach all the vertices in the SCC, since v can reach all vertices in the SCC.
So, by definition, vertex w should be part of the SCC, which leads to a contradiction.
Therefore, if two vertices are in the same SCC, there is no path between them that ever leaves the SCC.
