4.2.6.2

If we replace the priority queue with a queue / stack / vector / hash table / set, Kahn's algorithm remains correct.
When using different data structures, the order in which the vertices will be processed will be different, generating
possibly different topological sorts. But they will all be valid and Kahn's algorithm will remain correct.
This is because we just need a container to store the vertices with zero in-degree, the actual order in which we process
those vertices does not matter to generate a valid topological sort.
