4.3.2.1

This early termination does not change the correctness of Kruskal's algorithm because the edges are sorted by weight.
This means that any edge not yet processed will have an equal or higher weight than the edges already seen.
Also, Kruskal's algorithm only takes edges that will be part of the final MST.
Therefore, the total weight will never decrease and it is possible to terminate the algorithm as soon as we take
V - 1 edges, since these edges will be part of the MST and the remaining edges will not replace any edges taken.
The same optimization can be implemented using UFDS by terminating the algorithm once there is only 1 disjoint set
remaining.
