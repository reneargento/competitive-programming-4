4.3.4.3

The MST problem can be solved in O(E) if the input graph is guaranteed to have edge weights that lie between the
integer range of [0..100].

This can be done by having an array of lists, where each index of the array stores a list of edges that have weight
equal to that index.
Array[0] would store edges of weight 0, Array[1] would store edges of weight 1, and so on.
We could then iterate over these lists from index 0 to 100 and try to add each edge to the MST, as long as it does not
create a cycle, until we have V - 1 edges added.
The cycle check can be done using Union-Find, in the same way as Kruskal's algorithm.
Having the array of lists is the equivalent as using counting sort for the sorting phase of Kruskal's algorithm.

This is a significant speed-up from O(E lg V), as the lg V factor is removed, and this can be the difference on getting
AC or not in problems with tighter time limits.
