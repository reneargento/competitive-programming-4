4.3.4.2

The Second Best ST problem can be solved with Prim's algorithm in a similar way as it is done with Kruskal's algorithm:
1- Run Prim's algorithm to compute the MST edges.
2- For each edge in the MST:
2.1 - Flag this edge.
2.2 - Run Prim's algorithm on the original graph skipping the flagged edge.
      Keep track of the best MST computed and the associated new edge added and edge removed.
3- The Second Best ST will be the best ST computed on step 2.

The best time complexity of this approach is:
O(find the original MST + Prim's algorithm for each edge in the MST)
O(E lg V + (E lg V) * V)
O(V * E + V lg V)
O(V * E)

This running time is V times slower than the running time of O(E lg V) using LCA in Exercise 4.3.4.1.
