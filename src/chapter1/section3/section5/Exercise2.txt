1.3.5.2

1. The code is missing parentheses on the S values.
The correct should be:
#define LSOne(S) ((S) & -(S))

2. __builtin_ctz(v) is for 32-bit int. For 64-bit int __builtin_ctzl(v) should be used.

3. Using ms.erase(v) will erase all copies of v. To erase just one copy of v use ms.erase(ms.find(v)).

4. The iterator is invalidated when the vector has to double its size and reallocate its contents.

5. Pointers/references are also invalidated when the vector has to double its size and reallocate its contents.
