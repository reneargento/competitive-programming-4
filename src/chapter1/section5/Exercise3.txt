1.5.3

First we can transform all characters to lowercase using the toLowerCase() method in the String class.
Then we add all lowercase vowels to a hash set.
Iterate through the characters in T and for each character check if it is a digit with the method isDigit() from the Character class.
If it is, increment the digit count. Otherwise, check if it is a letter with the method isLetter() from the Character class.
If it is, check if the letter is contained in the vowel set. If it is, increment the vowel count. Otherwise, increment the consonant count.
