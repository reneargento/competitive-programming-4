a) To find the first occurrence of a substring in a string we can use the method indexOf(String) of the String class.
b) To find the next occurrences we can use the method indexOf(String, int fromIndex) of the String class.
Every time we find an occurrence we update the value of fromIndex to the occurrence index + 1, to start the search from the next index.
Repeat until the indexOf() method returns -1.
